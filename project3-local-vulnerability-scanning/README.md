# Project 3 â€“ Local Vulnerability Scanning
---
## Objective
Identify local vulnerabilities using OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials and remediate them.

## Tools
OpenVAS (GVM) or Nessus Essentials, Nmap, Ubuntu 24.04

## Steps
1) Install & init scanner
2) First scan (Full & Fast / Basic Network Scan)
3) Analyze findings (focus High/Critical)
4) Remediate & re-scan
5) Automate weekly scan + export

## Artifacts
- reports/: PDF/CSV exports named YYYY-MM-DD_<scanner>_<profile>_<target>.*
- screenshots/: key UI shots (dashboard, findings, before/after)
- docs/findings-summary.md: Top CVEs, root causes
- docs/remediation-plan.md: Actions, owners, ETA

## Outcome
Reduced High/Critical vulns; weekly automated scan with saved reports.
