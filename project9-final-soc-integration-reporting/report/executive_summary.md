# Executive Summary — Container Runtime Security Event

A security monitoring system detected unauthorized interactive shell access inside a containerized web application.  
The activity was identified at runtime using behavioral detection and investigated through centralized security monitoring.

Although performed in a controlled lab environment, this scenario demonstrates how modern SOCs detect and investigate high-risk container activity that could indicate post-exploitation or unauthorized access.

The project highlights the value of combining runtime detection with centralized monitoring to provide rapid detection, investigation, and reporting of security incidents in containerized environments.
