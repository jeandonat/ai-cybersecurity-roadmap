Step 7 — AI-Enhanced Threat Detection

This project contains a set of machine-learning tools and notebooks for detecting malicious behavior in authentication logs.
It extends the previous automation steps by introducing:

Log-based feature extraction

VirusTotal-based labeling

Supervised learning models

Unsupervised anomaly detection

Model evaluation (ROC / Precision-Recall curves)

Exported model artifacts

The components are lightweight and designed for SOC automation, enrichment pipelines, and security data science experimentation.

Tools Included

1) anomaly_detection.ipynb

A Jupyter Notebook that:

Loads parsed log + threat-intel data

Builds a feature dataset

Labels entries as benign/malicious

Trains multiple ML models

Evaluates detection performance

Saves the trained model to disk

Models included:

Logistic Regression

RandomForestClassifier

IsolationForest (anomaly detection)

Data Files

Used during training and stored in the data/ directory:

auth_log_parsed.csv — parsed authentication log data

features.csv — numerical feature matrix

labels.csv — model labels (0 = benign, 1 = malicious)

Model Outputs

Generated by the notebook and saved in models/:

anomaly_model.pkl — the exported machine-learning model

This file can be used later inside automation scripts or an inference API.

Evaluation Charts

Generated by the notebook and stored in charts/:

roc_curve.png — ROC curve for supervised models

pr_curve.png — Precision-Recall curve

These help assess how well the model separates malicious from benign events.
