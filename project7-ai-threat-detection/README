# Step 7 — AI-Enhanced Threat Detection

This project contains a machine-learning workflow designed to identify malicious activity in authentication logs. It expands previous steps by adding dataset creation, supervised and unsupervised models, and evaluation metrics such as ROC and Precision-Recall curves.

## Components

### anomaly_detection.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook that:
- Loads parsed authentication logs
- Builds feature and label datasets
- Uses VirusTotal reputation results to assign benign/malicious labels
- Trains supervised models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Trains an unsupervised anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest)
- Generates ROC and Precision-Recall curves
- Saves a trained ML model

## Data Files

Located in the `data/` directory:
- auth_log_parsed.csv — Parsed authentication log entries
- features.csv — Numerical feature dataset
- labels.csv — Class labels (0 = benign, 1 = malicious)

## Model Artifacts

Located in the `models/` directory:
- anomaly_model.pkl — Exported trained model

## Evaluation Charts

Located in the `charts/` directory:
- roc_curve.png — ROC curve for supervised models
- pr_curve.png — Precision-Recall curve
