# Step 7 — AI-Enhanced Threat Detection

This project introduces a machine-learning workflow designed to detect malicious authentication activity.  
It builds on the parsed log data created earlier in the roadmap, then generates a synthetic dataset that 
allows supervised and unsupervised models to learn patterns of malicious vs. benign behavior.

The notebook trains multiple ML models, evaluates them using ROC and Precision-Recall curves, and exports a
trained classifier for later SOC automation.

## Components

### 🧪 anomaly_detection.ipynb
A Jupyter Notebook that:

- Loads authentication log features & labels  
- Trains supervised models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
- Trains an unsupervised anomaly detector:
  - Isolation Forest  
- Generates:
  - ROC Curve (`roc_curve.png`)  
  - Precision–Recall Curve (`pr_curve.png`)  
- Saves a trained ML model (`anomaly_model.pkl`)
